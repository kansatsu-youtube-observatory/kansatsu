# The Effects of Disaggregated Factors of YouTube Recommendations in Diversity

<p> Ramaciotti Morales, Pedro, Benbouzid, Bilel, Gauthier, Emma, Perrier, Alexis</p>

We are in the midsts of an active debate about the effects that algorithms have on the digital publicspace.  As they filter, select, and influence what comes to our attention, the effects of algorithms arepolitical, social, cultural, as well of economic. This debate has also come to encompass important phe-nomena such as radicalization, and the so-calledecho chambersandfilter bubbles.  Most interactionsbetween users and with content take place in a few platforms that account for a wealth of scientificworks.  YouTube, an important content provider (the second most popular site as of 2019), has beencomparatively less investigated.In this study we set out to identify how different relations between YouTube channels may affectthe diversity of content watched by users.  We propose agent-based simulations to explore the conse-quences of privileging some of these relations (generated by explicit human interactions or computedalgorithmically) in recommendations.  We consider a set of YouTube channels from a single country–in our case France– to better account for its representativeness within an informational ecosystem.This set includes the channels of political parties and personalities, news outlets,youtubers, indepen-dent media, companies, and social movements that have the most subscribers, reaching nearly 1400channels. We then proceed to establish relations between channels by consulting YouTube’s API andby web-crawling during Jan-May 2019. Four relations are considered: two of them (human) dependingon explicit user actions, and two of them (algorithmic) computed algorithmically by YouTube. Theserelations are represented in four networks of channels:a) Featured network(human), in which chan-nelAis linked to channelBif the administrator of channelAdecided to include channelBin thefeaturedsection of channelA,b) CoCommented network(human),  in which channelAis linkedto channelBif there is a significant number of users commenting videos of both channels,c) Rec-ommended network(algorithmic), in which channelAis linked to a channelBif a video fromBwas recommended in the lateral bar in a video from channelA,d) Related network(algorithmic), inwhich channelAis linked to a channelBif it appears in therelatedsection in channelB(this amountsto channel recommendation and was discontinued in May 2019). In order to have a classification overwhich to measure diversity of video consumption in simulations, these channels were then classifiedmanually  into  one  of  12  categories:  political  comment,  complotism,  militant groups,  investigativejournalism, entertainment, grassroots movements, traditional media, local media, theme-specializedmedia, conferences/interviews, public relations, and political vulgarization.To study the effects of following hypothetical recommendations computed with each one of thesefour  networks,  we  propose  an  agent-based  simulation  [2].   On  each  network  we  consider  random walks of different lengths (to simulate different user engagement levels), and for each length we per-form 10.000 simulations, storing the categories of channels visited during the walks.  Then, for eachnetwork, and each length of walk we compute the diversity of categories visited, using Perplexity (ameasure of uncertainty of visited channel category, closely related to Shannon entropy) [3] to account forboth the number of categories and their apportionment.  Crucially, we distinguish collective diversity(computed with the categories visited by all 10.000 agents) from the individual diversities (computedfor each agent) to separate the system-wide effects from those on individual watching experience.One possible organization of the factors that influence actual recommendations in YouTube canbe organized in two groups:  users’ characteristics (personalized,  or user-centric) and videos’ char-acteristics (video-centric, orcold-start) [1].  Our agent-based simulations provide insights about thelatter.  Simulations usingFeaturedandCoCommented networksshow what the effects would beof weighting more of the traces of human actions underlying these networks in the computation ofthe video-centric part of recommendations.  In comparison, simulations obtained using theRelatednetworkuse only algorithmic similarity computed by YouTube, andRecommended networkservesas baseline representing the effects that actual recommendations have on diversity.In this work, we analyze the effects that these disaggregated factors have to show that includingmore traces of human actions in cold-start recommendations could –depending on the mixing of user-and video-centric factors– improve the diversity of contents watched by a collective of people, butnot  necessarily  the  diversity  experienced  by  individuals.   We  also  suggest  that  both  collective  andindividual diversities resulting from actual recommendations are higher that those that would resultfrom recommending based purely in YouTube’s similarity. In our study we also address the algorithmicvisibility of the different categories of channels that result from giving more weight to factors hereidentified.   Finally,  we  discuss  how  network  clusterizations  compare  between  these  four  networkswhen contrasted with our expert categorization to comment on the relation between the so-calledfilterbubblesand contents offered by channels.
