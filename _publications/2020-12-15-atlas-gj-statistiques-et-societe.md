The way the Yellow Vests refer to external sources on the web --whether websites or YouTube channels-- also sheds light on their relationship with the media. We rely on an existing characterization of the most used media in the digital public space to grasp their relationship to mainstream, militant media (whether right or left) or to the counter-informational space. The analysis of these practices of media use shows that the Yellow Vests build their discourse by relying largely on media and the so-called ``alternative'' expression platforms (auto-media, videos, live, etc.) 
Overall, we note a great geographic and ideological plurality, but also a heterogeneous and constantly evolving repertoire of demands. However, a form of political opposition to power unites our groups which also cultivate a rejection of the modes of representation of the movement made by the traditional media.
